# A basic implementation of Wit.ai API

Get your https://wit.ai/ key.

Add your web/app_key.php file with contents:

    <?php $key = 'Your wit.ai key here';
    
  # Get started
Go to the `chatbot-docker` directory and run `docker-compose up -d`

Got to your browser and hit:
http://chatbot.localhost:8000 

What you see on that page will not apply to your project because you need to use your own information to train your wit.ai app.
